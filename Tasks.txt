Idea:
    BlackJack Game for one or two players with 4 other bot players
Brainstorming:
    What does your program do?
    - create one or multiple decks(player decision)
    - have the ability to deal out cards
    - create a dealer bot
    - create multiple player bots with logic(like if card total less than 12 hit)
    - use multiple classes
    - scoring system
    - terminal animations
    How will it work in a terminal?
